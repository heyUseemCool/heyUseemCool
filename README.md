## about us ♥︎
***
  we r an endogenic plural/system</br>
+  we have slight phantom sense and it differs per headmate  
++  we use contradictory lables collectively  
+++  we are anti harassment over fiction.

prerequisits to being friends :
- you gotta be normal about && okay with the above ⤴︎⤴︎
- you gotta be 16 - 22 yrs old as we are bodily 18

uh yeah i think thats all</br>
  we are generally pretty chill, we like cuddling if we know you, 

***
Fer ppl we arent friends with + general boundaries are, 
- please do not kiss/boop us without asking
- same with cuddling/hiding
- pls do not cover our pony/sit on top of us
- +  if you do accidentally pls move when we ask
- w2i preferred as we are more often than not semi offtab/afk
- don't send us friend requests without asking
- +  obvs dont get heated if we don't accept
- ++  don't try and send another after we've denied it or we'll block
  
this should really go without saying but don't try and debate us on our identities or fakeclaim us unless you want a debate. like if you say something we are Going to say something back.</br>
oh and also we don't care enough about shipcourse to debate anyone on it so we'll probably just ignore you or shut you down if you try to start a debate on that.

Last but not least, this is an alt account. i don't give my main git out anymore unless we're friends 👍
